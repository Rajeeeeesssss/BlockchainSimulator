**Project Report: Blockchain Simulator**

**1. Title of the Project**

**Blockchain Simulator**

---

 **2. Introduction**

Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that ensures secure, transparent, and tamper-proof data storage. Each block contains a set of transactions, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash of the previous block, making the chain immutable. This project simulates a simple blockchain to demonstrate the working of mining, transactions, and block validation.

---

 **3. Objective**

The main objectives of this project are:

* To understand the core concepts of blockchain technology.
* To simulate the creation of blocks and the addition of transactions.
* To implement mining using proof-of-work.
* To verify the integrity and validity of the blockchain.

---

 **4. Technologies Used**

* **Programming Language:** Java
* **Build Tool:** Maven
* **Hashing Algorithm:** SHA-256
* **IDE:** Any Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, VS Code)
* **OS:** Windows/Linux

 **5. Project Design**

### **5.1 Classes and Their Responsibilities**

1. **Main Class**

   * Entry point of the project.
   * Initializes the blockchain, adds blocks, and displays the chain.

2. **Blockchain Class**

   * Maintains a list of blocks.
   * Adds new blocks and validates the chain.

3. **Block Class**

   * Stores index, timestamp, list of transactions, previous hash, and hash.
   * Calculates hash and performs mining using proof-of-work.

4. **Transaction Class**

   * Represents a transaction with sender, receiver, and amount.

5. **StringUtil Class**

   * Contains a utility function to compute SHA-256 hash.

---

 **6. Implementation Details**

 **6.1 Mining and Proof-of-Work**

* Mining involves calculating a hash that starts with a certain number of zeros (difficulty).
* The `mineBlock()` function increases the nonce until the hash satisfies the difficulty criteria.

 **6.2 Adding Transactions**

* Each block stores multiple transactions.
* Transactions are added to the block using `addTransaction()`.

 **6.3 Chain Validation**

* The blockchain is validated using `isChainValid()`, which checks:

  * If the hash of the block is correct.
  * If the `previousHash` of each block matches the hash of the previous block.

 **7. Sample Output**

```
Mining block 1...
Block mined: 0000a7b1c2d3e4f5...
Mining block 2...
Block mined: 0000b2c3d4e5f6a7...

Blockchain is valid: true

Full Blockchain:
Block{index=0, timestamp=1694179200000, transactions=[], previousHash='0', hash='0000123abcd...'}
Block{index=1, timestamp=1694179260000, transactions=[Alice -> Bob: 50, Charlie -> David: 25], previousHash='0000123abcd...', hash='0000a7b1c2d3e4f5...'}
Block{index=2, timestamp=1694179320000, transactions=[Eve -> Frank: 100], previousHash='0000a7b1c2d3e4f5...', hash='0000b2c3d4e5f6a7...'}
```

 **8. Advantages**

* Provides a clear understanding of blockchain mechanics.
* Demonstrates proof-of-work mining.
* Simple yet effective simulation of real-world blockchain functionality.
* Fully implemented in Java with modular classes.

---

 **9. Limitations**

* Not a full-scale blockchain; only for simulation and learning purposes.
* Does not include advanced features like peer-to-peer networking or smart contracts.
* Mining difficulty is small for demonstration purposes.

---

 **10. Future Scope**

* Implement a peer-to-peer network for a decentralized blockchain.
* Integrate smart contracts for automated transactions.
* Add digital signatures for transaction verification.
* Improve user interface for better interaction.
* Optimize mining for higher difficulty levels.

---

**11. Conclusion**

This project successfully simulates a blockchain, demonstrating how transactions are stored in blocks, how blocks are mined using proof-of-work, and how the chain maintains its integrity. It provides a solid foundation for understanding blockchain technology and can be extended to more advanced blockchain applications.

If you want, I can **also create a nicely formatted Word/PDF version** of this report ready to submit, complete with **diagrams of blockchain and block structure** for visuals.

Do you want me to do that next?
